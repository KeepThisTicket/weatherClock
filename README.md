# software_weatherClock #

An digital analog clock but instead of showing the hours, the clock shows the weather at that hour of the day. So instead of showing 1, it will show the weather forecast for 1AM/PM. Click on the hour for more detailed information such as wind, precipitation and more. Once in the detailed view, simply click the center again to return to the analog clock face.

You will need to obtain your own OpenWeatherMap API key from https://openweathermap.org/

In my testing setup I use a Pi Zero W with a Pimoroni 4" touchscreen.

I have experienced an issue with running this on the Pi Zero W - after a few days, the program starts to get super slow and at some point the program closes itself.

For any questions/comments - you can open an issue or contact me directly at k3vinwu25@gmail.com
